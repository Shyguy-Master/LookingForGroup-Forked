/*

Project Card is featured on the Discover Page as the way for users to see
information about a project recommended to them.

The card should be visually appealing, have enough information to get a user to click,
and be somewhat compact.

Right now the ProjectCard features Name, Bio, Project Picture, Desired Skills, and Desired Roles

ProjectCard uses the same styling as ProfileCard as they serve a similar role.

They are separate components because the ProjectCard displays pronouns and the 
ProjectCard displays desired roles.

I think the two components could be consolidated but would need to display and format content conditionally

The information for the card is pulled from static data in fakeData.ts

Eventually the data should be pulled from a database

This component is not necessarily the final version and doesn't match the visual design of the latest wireframes
